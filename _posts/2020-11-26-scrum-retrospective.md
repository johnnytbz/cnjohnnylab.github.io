**Prep 15 MIN**

For remote teams, start by creating a new collaboration document, like a Confluence page.

On the page, board, paper, or whiteboard, create three columns with the headings “What we did well”, “What we can do better”, and “Actions”.

**Set the stage 5 MINS**
    
Don’t make it personal, don’t take it personally

Listen with an open mind

Everyone’s experience is valid

Set the time period you’re discussing (last sprint, last quarter, entire project, etc.)

Focus on improvement, rather than placing blame

**What we did well 15 MIN**

Using either a digital whiteboard or a physical one, have each team member write down what the team did well, one idea per note. 

Post the notes, and group similar or duplicate ideas together. Discuss each one briefly as a team.

**What we can do better 10 MINS**
    
Have everyone write down what they think can be improved, one idea per note. 

Post the notes, and group similar or duplicate ideas together. Discuss each theme as a team.    

**Actions 10 MINS**
    
Have everyone brainstorm actions that can be taken to improve problem areas, one idea per note.

Post the notes and group similar or duplicate ideas. 

Discuss each idea as a team, and assign owners to these actions and due dates as necessary.
