### 4 documents

**Production Backlog**

A product backlog is a list of the new features, changes to existing features, bug fixes, infrastructure changes or other activities that a team may deliver in order to achieve a specific outcome.

**Sprint Backlog**

A sprint backlog is the subset of product backlog that a team targets to deliver during a sprint in order to accomplish the sprint goal and make progress toward a desired outcome.

**Burn-down chart**

A burndown chart is a chart often used in scrum agile development to track work completed against time allowed. The x-axis is the time frame, and the y-axis is the amount of remaining work left that is labeled in story points and man hours, etc. The chart begins with the greatest amount of remaining work, which decreases during the project and slowly burns to nothing.
  
**Barriers backlog**

issue and pending backlog
